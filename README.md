### Discord bot to remotely monitor and control a docker based server. Using the docker socket.

## üôè Credits & Attribution

This bot is based on the excellent work by **[allenrkeen](https://github.com/allenrkeen)**.

**Original Repository:** https://github.com/allenrkeen/server-bot  
**Original Docker Image:** `allenrkeen/server-bot`

## üÜï Enhanced Version Features

This fork maintains full compatibility with the original bot while adding new functionality:

### üéÆ Steam Deck Monitoring
- **Automatic daily checks** for Steam Deck sales and availability
- **Smart notifications** that alert only on price changes or new deals
- **Real-time manual checking** with `/steamdeck` command
- **Configurable Discord notifications** via channel setup

### üì∫ Media Server Integration
- **Plex & Jellyfin management** commands
- **Live streaming server** setup and control
- **Container-based media services** with easy deployment

### üîß Enhanced Stability
- **Improved error handling** and logging
- **Robust timeout protection** for external API calls
- **Extended configuration options** for better customization

---

## üöÄ Setup

Setup is pretty straightforward.

1. Create a new application in the *[discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)*
2. Go to the bot section and click *Add Bot*
3. Reset Token and keep the token somewhere secure (This will be referred to as "DISCORD_TOKEN" in .env and docker environment variables)
4. Get the "Application ID" from the General Information tab of your application (This will be referred to as "DISCORD_CLIENT_ID" in .env and docker environment variables)
5. *Optional:* If you have developer mode enabled in Discord, get your server's ID by right-clicking on the server name and clicking "Copy ID" (This will be referred to as "DISCORD_GUILD_ID" in .env and docker environment variables)
   - If you skip this, it will still work, but commands will be published globally instead of to your server and can take up to an hour to be available in your server.
   - Using the Server ID will be more secure, making the commands available only in the specified server.

## üì¶ Installation Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Version (Docker - Recommended)

```bash
# Enhanced version with Steam Deck monitoring and media features

-e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here \
-e DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here \
-e STEAM_DECK_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here \
sawell1/discord-bot:latest
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  server-bot:
    container_name: server-bot
    image: sawell1/discord-bot:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
      - DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
      - DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here

docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name server-bot \

-e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here \
-e DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here \
allenrkeen/server-bot:latest

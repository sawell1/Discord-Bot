### Discord bot to remotely monitor and control a docker based server. Using the docker socket.

## üôè Credits & Attribution

This bot is based on the excellent work by **[allenrkeen](https://github.com/allenrkeen)**.

**Original Repository:** https://github.com/allenrkeen/server-bot  
**Original Docker Image:** `allenrkeen/server-bot`

## üÜï Enhanced Version Features

This fork maintains full compatibility with the original bot while adding new functionality:

### üéÆ Steam Deck Monitoring
- **Automatic daily checks** for Steam Deck sales and availability
- **Smart notifications** that alert only on price changes or new deals
- **Real-time manual checking** with `/steamdeck` command
- **Configurable Discord notifications** via channel setup
- **Time configuration** - Set check time directly in Discord
- **User & Role pings** - Notify specific users or entire roles
- **Smart ping modes** - Only on sales or all checks

### ü§ñ Discord Logging System
- **Real-time bot logs** directly in Discord channels
- **Replaces Portainer log checking** - no more browser tabs needed
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - startup, checks, errors, config changes
- **Professional formatting** with Discord embeds and timestamps

### üîß Enhanced Stability
- **Improved error handling** and logging
- **Robust timeout protection** for external API calls
- **Extended configuration options** for better customization

## üöÄ Setup

Setup is pretty straightforward.

1. Create a new application in the *[discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)*
2. Go to the bot section and click *Add Bot*
3. Reset Token and keep the token somewhere secure (This will be referred to as "DISCORD_TOKEN" in .env and docker environment variables)
4. Get the "Application ID" from the General Information tab of your application (This will be referred to as "DISCORD_CLIENT_ID" in .env and docker environment variables)
5. *Optional:* If you have developer mode enabled in Discord, get your server's ID by right-clicking on the server name and clicking "Copy ID" (This will be referred to as "DISCORD_GUILD_ID" in .env and docker environment variables)
   - If you skip this, it will still work, but commands will be published globally instead of to your server and can take up to an hour to be available in your server.
   - Using the Server ID will be more secure, making the commands available only in the specified server.

## üì¶ Installation Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Version (Docker - Recommended)

```bash
# Enhanced version with Steam Deck monitoring
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name server-bot \
-e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here \
-e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here \
-e DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here \
-e STEAM_DECK_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here \
-e BOT_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_log_channel_id_here \
sawell1/discord-bot:latest
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  server-bot:
    container_name: server-bot
    image: sawell1/discord-bot:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
      - DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
      - DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here
      - STEAM_DECK_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
      - BOT_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_log_channel_id_here
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option 3: Original Version

```bash
# Original version by allenrkeen (core functionality only)
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name server-bot \
-e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here \
-e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here \
-e DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here \
allenrkeen/server-bot:latest
```

The program will build an invite link with the correct permissions and put it in the logs. Click the link and confirm the server to add the bot to.

## ÔøΩ Quick Setup Guide

### Basic Setup (Core Features Only):
1. Use `allenrkeen/server-bot` Docker image
2. Set required environment variables: `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`

### Enhanced Setup (Steam Deck + Logging):
1. Use `sawell1/discord-bot` Docker image
2. Set basic environment variables
3. **Configure Steam Deck monitoring:**
   - `/steamdeck-config channel #steam-alerts` - Set notification channel
   - `/steamdeck-config time 14:30` - Set check time
   - `/steamdeck-config ping-add-role @SteamDeals` - Add role for notifications
4. **Configure Discord logging:**
   - `/steamdeck-config log-channel #bot-logs` - Replace Portainer log checking
5. **Test setup:**
   - `/steamdeck-config status` - View complete configuration
   - `/steamdeck` - Manual check to test functionality

### Recommended Workflow:
1. Create Discord roles: `@SteamDeals`, `@BotAdmins`
2. Create Discord channels: `#steam-alerts`, `#bot-logs`
3. Configure bot with commands above
4. Users can self-assign `@SteamDeals` role for notifications
